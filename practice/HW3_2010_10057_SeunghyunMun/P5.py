Practical programming Chapter 9 Exercise 12

**Instruction**
When P5([1, 2, 3, -3, 6, -1, -3, 1]) is executed, it produces [1, 2, 3, 6, -3, 1].
The for loop traverses the elements of the list, and when a negative value
(like -3 at position 3) is reached, it is removed, shifting the subsequent
values one position earlier in the list (so 6 moves into position 3). The
loop then continues on to process the next item, skipping over the value
that moved into the removed itemâ€™s position. If there are two negative
numbers in a row (like -1 and -3), then the second one wonâ€™t be removed.
Rewrite the code to avoid this problem.
Assume each element of input list is always number.

Remove the negative numbers from the list num_list.
>>> numbers = [-5, 1, -3, 2]
>>> P5(numbers)
>>> numbers
[1, 2]
