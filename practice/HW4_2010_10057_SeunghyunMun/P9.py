Same explanation with P8 (sparse vector)

The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of corresponding elements. 
For example, the dot product of [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] is 4+10+18 = 32. 
Implement another function that calculates the dot product of two sparse vectors.

>>>P9({0:1, 6:3}, {1:-1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:1})
0

>>>P9({0:1, 6:-3}, {0:-1, 6:3})
